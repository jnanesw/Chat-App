# How to test the Chat App (two users)

Use this deployed URL:
https://chat-app-916297375578.europe-west1.run.app/chat

Steps:
1. Open Browser A and go to the URL above.
2. Open Browser B (different browser or an Incognito/Private window) and go to the same URL.
3. In Browser A enter a name (e.g., Alice). In Browser B enter a different name (e.g., Bob).
4. In Browser A type a message and click Send.
5. Confirm the message appears in Browser B as well.
6. Reply from Browser B and confirm Browser A receives it.

That's it — two browser windows = two members.
